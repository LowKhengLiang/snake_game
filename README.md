# Q-learning Snake Game
This is a toy project referenced from a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp to train an reinforcement learning model to play the snake game.
# Dependencies
1) pygame
2) matplotlib
3) ipython
4) pytorch
# How to understand?
1) game.py is the snake game environment created using pygame.
2) model.py is the Q-deep learning model created using pytorch.
3) helper.py is the modeling of the performance metrics of the snake.
4) agent.py is the state, action, memory, and training of the snake to play the game.
