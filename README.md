# Q-learning Snake Game
This is a toy project referenced from a tutorial from FreeCodeCamp to train an reinforcement learning model to play the snake game.
# Dependencies
1) pygame
2) matplotlib
3) ipython
4) pytorch
# How to understand?
1) game.py is the snake game environment created using pygame.
2) model.py is the Q-deep learning model created using pytorch.
3) helper.py is the modeling of the performance metrics of the snake.
4) agent.py is the state, action, memory, and training of the snake to play the game.
# How to run the game?
1) Open terminal and navigate to the folder that contains the files using the command: cd file_path
2) Create a python environment using the command: create -n pygame_env python=3.7
3) Activate the environment using the command: activate pygame_env
4) Install the dependencies using the command: pip install pygame matplotlib ipython
5) Install pytorch using the command: pip install torch torchvision
6) Run the application using the command: python agent.py
